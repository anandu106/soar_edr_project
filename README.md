# SOAR and EDR Project 

## Summary
In this project we will configure a SOAR using Tines and LimaCharlie as the EDR tool. This project will show how to automate security workflows, and enhance your cybersecurity posture effectively. It will guide us through the configuration process and show how these tools work together to provide real-time security insights and responses.

## System Requirements
We will create a Windows Server VM as the endpoint for this project. The VM will be installed on VMware Workstation. Therefore minimum requirement for the host machine will be:

- RAM: 16GB 
- Disk Space: 60 GB free space.
